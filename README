First, note that complete20.vcf contains a sample of 1000 SNPs from
chromosome 20 over 2504 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project,
filtered so that MAF > 0.01. Next, missing20.vcf contains the same
sample of 1000 SNPs from complete20.vcf but only on a subset of 500
individuals. In it, the true genotype is masked for at 10% of the SNPs
(genotypes are "missing" at such SNPs across all indivudals). Next,
ref20.vcf contains the complete data for the 2004 individuals not
included in missing20.vcf. Further, we note that subset20.vcf contains
all 2504 individuals, for which 500 (the same 500 as in missing20.vcf)
have some missing data. Lastly, test.vcf is the output of the BEAGLE
algorithm's imputation when run on missing20.vcf with ref20.vcf as the
reference panel.
